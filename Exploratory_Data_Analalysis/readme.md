### **This focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), covering data understanding, summary statistics, data visualization, correlation analysis, and insights extraction to better understand patterns and relationships within the dataset.**


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder contains exploratory data analysis projects performed on real-world datasets to understand data patterns, distributions, and relationships before modeling.

The goal of these notebooks is to develop intuition about data and extract meaningful insights using visualization and statistics.

## Datasets Analyzed
